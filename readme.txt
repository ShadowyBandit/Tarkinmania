How to install
==========================================
First, locate the "bin" folder in the game's files.
It is normally found at "C:\Games\World_of_Warships\bin"

Next, select the folder with the highest number; they correspond to game version so naturally bigger = more recent.

Now, you should be able to see a folder called "res_mods". Enter it.

Copy the "gui" and texts" folders from the Tarkinmania mod and put them into the "res_mods" folder. 
If there are any file conflicts, just click "Skip these files". It's best not to break other mods.

Finally, you've got it installed, so give it a test run in port to make sure it works.

==========================================
How to uninstall
==========================================
Delete the "gui" and "texts" folder. If you had file conflicts when installing, don't delete anything and notify ShadowyBandit of your mods list. My discord tag is Z!#4639.

Warning
==========================================
Be careful when dismissing captains! Because they are all Tarkin, you might be unknowingly deleting a limited edition captain from Azur Lan, Transformers, etc.
